I am Wei Xing, a third-year PhD candidate at the College of Intelligent Science and Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, under the supervision of Professor Ye Xiufen. My research focuses on computer vision, particularly in the areas of image dehazing, deraining, and deblurring algorithms. I specialize in integrating deep learning with generative models, including techniques like Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, and GANs, to enhance and restore image quality.
